In this notebook, I will walk through my logic and processes used to clean the data and perform data transformations which includes conditionally filtering dataframes, applying user-created functions onto dataframes, performing mathematical operations with datetime objects, aggregating, merging, and concatenating dataframes, and finally feeding the data through a logistic regression model.\n",

    "The NBA Player of the Week is awarded to one player from each conference (East / West) for each week of the NBA regular season (with exceptions for the weeks of the NBA Cup semifinals and NBA All-Star game). Information about the criteria for the award is not publicly available (to my best knowledge), but a few general characteristics of players who have historically been winners of the award are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) _Outstanding individual performances_ - The player should have strongly positive production on the court and be a major contributor to his team's success\n",
    "2) _Team record_ - The player's team should win the majority of its games during the week\n",
    "3) _Availability_ - The player should not miss significant time during the week relative to the team's number of scheduled games in the week\n",

    "* Participation **`(played%)`** - The percentage of a player's team's games that he played in during the week. <br>\n",
    "* Team Games vs. Max **`(% vs. max)`** - The percentage of games scheduled for a player's team relative to the highest count of games scheduled in a week for a team per conference. For example: If the Lakers, Clippers, Nets and Knicks respectively had 3, 4, 2, and 5 games scheduled in a week, the variable should produce the following results: <br> <br>\n",

    "I'd like to re-emphasize that our model's 'accuracy' is not based on the R-squared value of the regression, but rather on whether the players with the highest probability from the model were the actual winners. However, the summary table gives us a good idea of which variables are the strongest influencers on the players that the model is choosing as the most likely winners of the award (bearing in mind that an 'average' game score is 10). Here are a few notable takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Given that **`win%`**, **`played%`**, and **`% vs. max`** are all bounded between 0 and 1, they are the easisest to compare at face-value. The model results imply that **`played%`** is the most influential characteristic, followed by **`win%`**, and lastly **`% vs. max.`** \n",
    "* Our constant in the model is negative, and is of significant magnitude relative to the bounded coefficients. In fact, assuming a player performs to an average standard (gscore = 10), plays in and wins all games during the week (**`win%`**, **`played%`** = 1.00), and is on a team with the most games in the conference during the week (**`% vs. max`** = 1.00), still results in a probability value <0! This is good news, because we would expect a player of the week to have to perform above average in order to win the award, which the model's parameters also are implying. A bit of algebra tells us that under these same conditions, a player would have to average a game score of ~18.3 to exceed a probability of zero. My guesstimation after glancing at __[the season leaders for average game score in 2023-24](https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/player-stat/game-score?season_id=221)__ is that 18.3 sits around borderline All-Star level output.\n",

    "__[2023-10-29 Player of the Week: Nikola Jokic (West)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/17k1hqj/nba_pr_denver_nuggets_center_nikola_joki%C4%87_and/)__ <br>\n",
    "Luka Doncic had a fantastic set of games in the week, averaging 41 PTS, 11.5 REB, 8.5 AST, and only 2.0 TOV on 71.3 TS%. However, he only played in two games compared to Jokic's three, which I think hurt his case. The model believes Doncic's exceptional performances should offset the difference in 1 game played between he and Jokic, when clearly the voting committee did not share that belief. Several users in the thread also expected Luka to be the winner.\n",

    "__[2024-03-03 Player of the Week: Jaylen Brown (East)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1b6kjn0/nba_pr_los_angeles_lakers_forward_lebron_james/)__ <br>\n",
    "Giannis Antetokounmpo played the same number of games as Jaylen Brown in the week (3GP) and had strong averages of 31.3 PTS, 11.3 REB, 4.0 AST and only 1.0 TOV on  76.0 TS%. However, his opponenents were the Hornets (2x) and the Bulls; the former had the worst Net Rating in the league through that point in the season (according to __[Cleaning The Glass](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/summary?season=2023&seasontype=regseason&start=09/29/2023&end=03/3/2024)__), while the Bulls were also in the bottom 10. Jaylen Brown's opponents were the 76ers, Mavericks, and Warriors whose net ratings were 11th, 14th, and 15th, respectively. Additionally, Giannis had already won Eastern Conference Player of the Week twice to this point in the season, while this was Jaylen Brown's first and only time winning the award in the 2023-24 season.\n",

    "__[2024-02-04 Player of the Week: Trae Young (East)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ajqp4u/nba_pr_la_clippers_forward_kawhi_leonard_and/)__ <br>\n",
    "I think this one is splitting hairs, as observed in comparing game scores between Donovan Mitchell and Trae Young. Mitchell had a compelling argument to win, having played more games (4 GP) than Trae (3 GP) while also not losing and averaging 32.3 PTS, 5.5 REB, 8.5 AST, 1.5 STL, 1.0 BLK and 2.5 TOV on 67.2 TS%. However, I think this is actually the opposite of case #1, where the model may be penalizing Trae too much for playing one fewer game. I would venture to guess that Trae Young had the second best odds of winning Eastern Conference Player of the Week in this week, despite the large delta in odds output by the model.\n",

    "__[2024-01-14 Players of the Week: Lauri Markkanen (West) and Bam Adebayo (East)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/197j0n7/nba_pr_utah_jazz_forward_lauri_markkanen_and/)__ <br>\n",
    "In the case of Lauri Markkanen and SGA, I believe this may be another example similar to case #2. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had won the Western Conference Player of the Week just two weeks prior, and was part of a 62 point victory against the Portland Trail Blazers (the 5th largest victory margin in NBA history through 2024), and a win against the Washington Wizards. The Blazers and Wizards were the 4th and 5th worst teams by net rating, respectively according to __[Cleaning The Glass](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/summary?season=2023&seasontype=regseason&start=09/29/2023&end=01/14/2024)__.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bam Adebayo vs. Donovan Mitchell argument is a simple one - Donovan Mitchell only played in one game during the week (compared to Bam playing in 4) and is not being penalized enough by the model. Bam Adebayo also impacts games defensively at an elite level, and defensive impact is not measured well by box score statistics alone, which the model is unable to capture."
